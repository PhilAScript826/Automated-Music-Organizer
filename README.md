# Automated Music Organizer

This program is a simple script that requires two inputs:
1. Genius API Token
2. File path to directory where your music is stored

The program iterates through the music in your directory and creates sub-directories based on the song's genre. In addition, it updates the song's date creation time to reflect the date and year the song was released.
